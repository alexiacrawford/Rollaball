The link to my game (should work on all computers):

https://alexiacrawford.github.io/Rollerball-play/

Credits to Unity for the tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=6 I added jump and double jump feature.

To play:

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the ball, use the space bar to jump/double jump
Try to collect all the green objects
Don't let the enemy (red) catch up to you!
